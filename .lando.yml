# Lando Project Yaml
#
#  This Lando file is meant to be where you define services and tooling specific to your project.
#  Where .lando.base.yml describes our base Magento tooling and services, this acts as a shared
#  config for your devs to quickly spin up services such as Redis, Elasticsearch, as well as
#  project-specific build steps.
